- maya.create_reference should only show maya_* publish types.


- refactor sgpublish.exporter
    
    - Instead of all of the methods passing kwargs around, perhaps there
      could be an ExportRequest, which would also have many of the extra
      wacky methods on it.

    - Exporter.promotion_fields -> Exporter.fields_for_review_version

    - Now that we don't nessesarily need the double import phase, can
      we move to::

        with sgpublish.publish_context(code='whatever', type='maya_scene') as publish:
            # `publish` is the PublishEvent entity fields already filled
            # out. Changes made to it will be pushed out assuming no
            # exceptions are raised. We don't really have a way to set
            # anything into the SGFS tag metadata, however. Perhaps if we treat
            # `publish['__metadata__']` as special...
            pass

        sgpublish.create_version_for_review(publish, **fields)

    - Maya extensions should be mixins?

        class CameraExporter(MayaExporterMixin, base.Exporter)

- class sgpublish.exporter.ui.dialog.Dialog(QtGui.QDialog):
    
    # Uses this as the exporter, AND to set base title, amoung other
    # things.
    exporter_class = MayaSceneExporter

    - Dialog.class_factory(name=None, **set_on_new_class)(**pass_to_exporter)
      Although, this is really the same as type('MyDialog', (Dialog, ), set_on_new_class)

    sgpublish.exporter.ui.dialog.maya.Dialog has the base maya extensions

    Perhaps this is what dependency injection is made for?


- sgpublish.importer
    
    - Importer
        .import_publish(publish, **kwargs) -> .import_(publish['sg_path'] or publish['sg_directory'], **kwargs)
        .import_(path, **kwargs)
    - ImportTabWidget
        - proxy to .import_ on the current tab
        - setPath iterates across the tabs calling setPath, and the last
          one to return True is selected
    - ImportPublish.import_(**kwargs) -> self.importer.import_publish(publish, **kwargs)
